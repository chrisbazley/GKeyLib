# GKeyLib
  This is a C library for compressing or decompressing data using the same algorithm used by old 4th Dimension and Fednet games such as 'Chocks Away', 'Stunt Racer 2000' and 'Star Fighter 3000'. It should have minimal dependencies on other libraries and must not include any platform-specific code.
